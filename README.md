# Number Guessing Game

## Description

This is a simple command-line Number Guessing Game implemented in Python. The game generates a random number between 1 and 1000, and the player tries to guess it. The game provides hints after each guess, indicating whether the guess is too high or too low.

## Features

- Random number generation between 1 and 1000
- User input validation
- Hints for each guess (too high/too low)
- Attempt counter
- Option to play multiple rounds

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## How to Play

1. When you start the game, you'll see a welcome message and the rules.
2. Enter your guess when prompted (a number between 1 and 1000).
3. The game will tell you if your guess is too high or too low.
4. Keep guessing until you find the correct number.
5. After you guess correctly, the game will show how many attempts it took.
6. You'll be asked if you want to play again.

## Game Rules

1. The game generates a random number between 1 and 1000.
2. You need to guess this number.
